In this entry we will visit the important criteria to become an active
investor, the mindset - a philosophy to investing. This mindset
transcends details of what instrument you are trading, what your goals
in life are etc. As the title suggests, our favorite instrument are
options but in this blog we will understand the mental approach required to
begin investing. I'll share what I've learnt from various resources that I have personally invested in. At the
very least you can walk away with a summary of these resources. These
resources range from expensive training sessions costing several
thousands of dollars, nearly a thousand dollars in books and online
video tutorials, and what I'd consider the most valuable lesson of
all, the tens of thousands that a retail trader loses in risky trades and
short-sighted decisions.  We'll walk step by step through the trades
(good and bad) and derive 'thumb rules' that must guide our trading
strategy. As a retail trader the most important measure we can take is
to design a set of basic rules and stay within the boundaries of these
rules. Yes, options trading is risky and it is not recommended for
those who cannot make an effort to understand these rules not just
different strategies. With simple yet careful calculations we can make
sure that we don't get into anything that we haven't planned the worst case
for.

If you are paying for favorite "stock picks" or "trade recommendations",
 many of which I have purchased in the past, I'd suggest that you get
 out of them. Such strategies often rely on the probability that a customer
 pays "a small fee" a.k.a. 100% real money in the hope of
 entering an elite club that's somehow informed about what the markets
 are going to do the next morning. Some of them make a few good
 recommendations occasionally but that is all there is to such
 schemes, occasional hits and frequent misses. There is no secret
 sauce apart from the fact that the game is tipped for the house to
 win. I want to put honest content out there which is easy for a common man to
understand. As far as the complexity of some of the strategies go,
 it's synthetic, not organic to the nature of the topic. Plain stocks
is a very simple concept: you pay the current market price to buy a
 stock which lets you own a small piece of the company itself. Options
 are basically contracts exchanged based on your outlook on a certain
 stock. Now this seemingly simple concept starts turning into a tricky
 and fun game-like concept. But what turns it into a complex,
 all-consuming beast that any long-term options investor/trader will
 recount is when there is greed. More practically, with [CBOE] and [OIC] video/audio tutorials it is now very
easy to understand any strategy. Most of these lectures
are delivered by professionals investors and traders who have seen many facets of
the industry over the years.

Many people, even the
smart ones shy away from the world of options trading. Human tendency
is to deny, reject or stay away from something that is not easily
understood. In this topic, there are several concepts that seem
intimidating and daunting. With the help of past experiences and
sometimes references to classic books on options trading such as:
[Options

I sincerely believe you will be able to understand the idea behind the
particular strategy or trade in question.
