In this entry we will visit the important criteria to become an active
investor, the mindset - a philosophy to investing. This mindset
transcends details of what instrument you are trading, what your goals
in life are etc. As the title suggests, our favorite instrument are
options but in this blog we will understand the mental approach required to
begin investing. I'll share what I've learnt from various resources that I have personally invested in. At the
very least you can walk away with a summary of these resources. These
resources range from expensive training sessions costing several
thousands of dollars, nearly a thousand dollars in books and online
video tutorials, and what I'd consider the most valuable lesson of
all, the tens of thousands that a retail trader loses in risky trades and
short-sighted decisions.  We'll walk step by step through the trades
(good and bad) and derive 'thumb rules' that must guide our trading
strategy. As a retail trader the most important measure we can take is
to design a set of basic rules and stay within the boundaries of these
rules. Yes, options trading is risky and it is not recommended for
those who cannot make an effort to understand these rules not just
different strategies. With simple yet careful calculations we can make
sure that we don't get into anything that we haven't planned the worst case
for.

If you are paying for favorite "stock picks" or "trade recommendations",
 many of which I have purchased in the past, I'd suggest that you get
 out of them. Such strategies often rely on the probability that a customer
 pays "a small fee" a.k.a. 100% real money in the hope of
 entering an elite club that's somehow informed about what the markets
 are going to do the next morning. Some of them make a few good
 recommendations occasionally but that is all there is to such
 schemes, occasional hits and frequent misses. There is no secret
 sauce apart from the fact that the game is tipped for the house to
 win. I want to put honest content out there which is easy for a common man to
understand. As far as the complexity of some of the strategies go,
 it's synthetic, not organic to the nature of the topic. Plain stocks
is a very simple concept: you pay the current market price to buy a
 stock which lets you own a small piece of the company itself. Options
 are basically contracts exchanged based on your outlook on a certain
 stock. Now this seemingly simple concept starts turning into a tricky
 and fun game-like concept. But what turns it into a complex,
 all-consuming beast that any long-term options investor/trader will
 recount is when there is greed. More practically, with [CBOE] and [OIC] video/audio tutorials it is now very
easy to understand any strategy. Most of these lectures
are delivered by professionals investors and traders who have seen many facets of
the industry over the years.

Many people, even the
smart ones shy away from the world of options trading. Human tendency
is to deny, reject or stay away from something that is not easily
understood. In this topic, there are several concepts that seem
intimidating and daunting. With the help of past experiences and
sometimes references to classic books on options trading such as:
[Options
Volatility and Pricing](http://www.amazon.com/Option-Volatility-amp-Pricing-Strategies/dp/155738486X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435645553&sr=1-2&keywords=options+volatility+and+pricing) [Options as a Strategic
Investment](http://www.amazon.com/Options-Strategic-Investment-Lawrence-McMillan/dp/0735204659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435645661&sr=1-1&keywords=options+as+a+strategic+investment)
I sincerely believe you will be able to understand the idea behind the
particular strategy or trade in question.

## Motivation
 What started off as a personal journal slowly turned into a useful
 textual summary of how to trade options. So I am publishing this in
 an attempt to save you the heartbreak and a roller-coaster ride in
 your options trading journey.

 I don't stand to gain (or lose for that matter!) anything real by
 publishing this content in this particular format. 

 Here I will try to list the various options trading strategies that I have tried and succeeded at and those that I have failed gloriously at too.

 The ones of particular interest will be those where I failed in the
 past and how I was able to derive these 'thumb rules' that I use to
 trade in my real life today. Along the course of this text, I will
 share actual numbers from my trades that are scaled proportionately,
 for the sake of illustration at times and for the sake of modesty at
 others. The hope here is that this book provides the reader with
 sufficient ammunition that the need to purchase those expensive
 materials and trainings that I had thrown my money upon does not
 arise.

## What to expect
 For the sake of clarity, the investment education industry is a very profitable business due to the very nature of the material it promises to teach. Comprehensive materials on derivatives and the theory governing the derivative markets are products of decades of research done by mathematicians (a.k.a rocket scientists!). While its nice to know the theory behind options pricing you won't be able to apply Black-Scholes' Model practically while trying to make trades at retail scales. I redirect the interested readers to the [original publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F260062).

 Quite honestly, these theories are encompassed in the indicators and signals that we will use in our thumb rules. The nature of these indicators vary from visual chart patterns to numerical to just plain common sense.

 At this point, you are perhaps eager to learn everything that you need to start trading and seeing real profits in your account. I must say this is the type of mental makeup that leads people n00bs and the veterans alike to bet on losing trades. Yes, I used the word 'bet' because that's without caution that's what you'd be doing, betting your money steadily on one desperate losing position to another.

 A new trader is typically in denial after each losing trade and tends to brush off and ignore a losing trade as a 'one-off' and march on to the next trade. This is not any different from walking from a Roulette Wheel table in Vegas where you have just lost more than your 'fun' budget and moving on to a 'warm' slot machine that somebody has just vacated in the hope that somehow you will recover all the money in another gambling proposition where the odds are stacked heavily against you.

 What I have learned is to treat each trade as though your life depended on it before you enter it or you will find yourself very soon deciding your next 'adjustment' in a real trade where your life actually depended on it. Please trade with caution and take all the measures so you don't find yourself in such a situation.

 I'm confident that if you internalized the details and steps of the 'system' presented here and traded with healthy amounts of caution, analysis and humility, then you will come out on top. You will be a winner.

 However, the methods listed in this book are not **sexy** in the common trading parlance. These methods are not going to make you billions in a short span of time. But they are designed to be effective and stable.

 The strategies listed in this book are an honest log of what I have used in the past. I will list the markets during which each of these strategies will yield the maximum returns. However, You will need the discipline to follow the checklist mentioned in this book.

 Make no mistake, this book is not a get rich easy method but an honest log of how an outsider could easily get into option trading business and make consistent profits.

 The most important attribute of a successful options trader is the ability to follow the rules and boundaries that he/she has set no matter what the external factors. This would require one to you to keep emotions in check during severe market conditions and believe me you will be tested.

 The primary characteristic of a successful options businessman is the ability to commit to the boundaries and rules that are a result of well-thought out plan. Once you spend the time and energy to come up with a plan it only makes sense to stick to it no matter what! It is not much of a plan if nobody is sticking to it. Execution trumps knowledge every time. Sure, the basic knowledge forms a foundation for a well thought out plan but top class execution is an absolute necessity for any plan to succeed even to a small extent.

 If you stick with the plan of action offered in this book you can
 rest assured that you will have a peace of mind of knowing the outcome of each
 of your trades (yes, even the worst cases). The most common reason for a trade to fail is the
 lack of commitment to stick to a plan because in the options world
 its very easy for a trader to be seduced by the meretricious metals
 out there. Do not fall prey to it, our plan will prevent us from
 falling prey like others do over and over again.
TODO: Link to the post containing the basic rules.

 If you commit to the plan and promise yourself that you will run this like you'd run your own business and not some game you would play on your console against a 10 year old then you are very likely to succeed in this business.

 Shift of mindset: How would you run a business?

 Imagine if you were given a choice to think of a business, say, a
 brick and mortar shop of some kind, decide the amount of capital you
 would like to put in, set up shop at any location of your choice in
 the world, define the risk parameters for the business (of course
 this would likely decide the extent of profits you'd reap too!), not
 having to deal with uncertainties of the real world that typical
 brick and mortar business owners deal with such as supplies of raw
 materials etc. You'd probably say <span class="underline">Wonderful
 I'd love to start such a business</span>. But here's the icing, what
 if I told you that you are allowed to do this for free and for as
 long as you want to before feeling sure of your decisions, strategies
 by testing it on the real world with real customers! Now how many
 businesses can you think of that come with this promise?
