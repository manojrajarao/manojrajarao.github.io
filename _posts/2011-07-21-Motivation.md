## Motivation
 What started off as a personal journal slowly turned into a useful
 textual summary of how to trade options. So I am publishing this in
 an attempt to save you the heartbreak and a roller-coaster ride in
 your options trading journey.

 I don't stand to gain (or lose for that matter!) anything real by
 publishing this content in this particular format. 

 Here I will try to list the various options trading strategies that I have tried and succeeded at and those that I have failed gloriously at too.

 The ones of particular interest will be those where I failed in the
 past and how I was able to derive these 'thumb rules' that I use to
 trade in my real life today. Along the course of this text, I will
 share actual numbers from my trades that are scaled proportionately,
 for the sake of illustration at times and for the sake of modesty at
 others. The hope here is that this book provides the reader with
 sufficient ammunition that the need to purchase those expensive
 materials and trainings that I had thrown my money upon does not
 arise.
